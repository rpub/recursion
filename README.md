# Recursion Exercises
Four Recursive Function Exercises

Do the following exercises:
1. Write a recursive function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence
1. Write a recursive function that takes in a string and outputs the string in reverse. (Do
 not use stack)
1. Write a recursive function that finds the position of the minimum element in an array
1. Write a recursive function that sorts an array using selection sort algorithm

**Note**
It is VERY important that you understand how to get to the solution of these problems, you
 may work with your classmates, we are not going to check if you copied the code, so it will
  be on you that you understand the concepts and how to solve this.
  
## Given
You are given a main function and the declaration and stubs of the functions. You may not
 change the main function except maybe the parameters of the functions if you decide to
  change them. *It is possible to write this program without changing the parameters of the
   given functions*. You may add functions to your program.

## Expected Output

Your output should be like this:
```
